            First Post! (11/1/23)

            <p>Welcome to my blog page. In this blog I will be talking about my favorite game Brawl Stars. Brawl Stars is a mobile only game that was created by the popular studio SuperCell. Brawl Stars lets you choose one of over seventy characters to take into a 10 person free for all, or a 3v3 game. 3v3 games include gem grab, brawl ball, heist, payload, and seige. Brawl stars may seem like a silly mobile game but it is rich with detailed game systems, awesome characters, cool cosmetics, and great fun!</p>

            <p>I recommend brawl stars to anyone who hasn't given it a shot yet or hasn't played it in a long time. There are so many characters to try out and they
                all have their own abilities and synnergies. Everytime I pick up the game I get to play a new match-up and learn more about the character I chose to
            play.</p>
    
            <p>One thing I really admire about SuperCell is that they have made all the paid cosmetics available to unlock by collecting a free-to-play currency
                called bling. Nothing in the game is behind a paywall and you can be free-to-play if you want which I think is a great thing.</p>

                Week 2: Tier List(11/5/23)
            </article>
        
                
            
            <article>
                <p>The list provided below is an up to date tier list of the current best brawlers in the game starting from the top right of "s-tier" going across right, to the bottom right.</p>

                <p> This update, we see the newest brawler, "Chuck" take the lead spot. Chuck has a neat ability to place down railroad posts and is able to quickly travel to them. This is a very unique ability that gives Chuck great map control and the ability to reposition very quickly. Another bonus is that while he is traveling from post to post, he does a lot of damage. This allows Chuck to move quick;y, deal lots of damage, and is very hard to get hit. This makes Chuck formidable in any game mode. Perhaps his biggest weakness is his normal attack speed and reload speed. If you are able to camp out at his post and wait for him to come to you, you may be able to quickly dispose of him.</p>
            
                <p>A brawler to keep an eye on this update is going to be Rosa (fifth brawler in A-tier with the green spike hands). Rosa is a boxing botanist that sports a large health pool, high damage up close, and a super ability that allows her to negate 80% of incoming damage for a few seconds. Her special gadgets let her place bushes on the map, and can also slow enemies that are hiding in bushes. This last update Roas was given a new hypercharge ablity. This allows her to be powered up beyond her normal limits after charging 3 super ablities. Her hypercharge allows her to slow down enemies around her after activating her super shield. This is great for rosa because she already excels at close range and this ability makes her kit that much stronger!</p>
